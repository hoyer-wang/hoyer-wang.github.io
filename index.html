<p style="text-align:justify">Hi, everyone! My name is Hongyue Wang, you can call me <b>Hoyer</b>. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at University of Jinan under the guidance of Prof.Zhiquan Feng. My research interests lie in the fascinating fields of human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. I have always been captivated by the endless possibilities that emerge when technology and human experiences converge.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">At the same time, I am thrilled to share that in May 2023, I was honored to be awarded the Monash University-China Scholarship Council (CSC) Joint Scholarship. This prestigious scholarship opens up new horizons for me as I embark on my Ph.D. journey. I am eagerly looking forward to joining Monash University and working with Prof.Florian 'Floyd' Mueller and the Exertion Games Lab on interactive food.</p>
