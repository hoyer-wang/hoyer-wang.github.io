<p style="text-align:justify">Greetings everyone! My name is Hongyue Wang, but you can call me <b>Hoyer</b>. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at the University of Jinan, under the guidance of Prof. Zhiquan Feng. My research interests mainly revolve around the captivating fields of human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. The convergence of technology and human experiences has always fascinated me due to the boundless possibilities it presents.</p>
