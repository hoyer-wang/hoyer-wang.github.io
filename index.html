Hello everyone! My name is Hongyue Wang, but you can call me Hoyer. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at the University of Jinan, under the guidance of Prof. Zhiquan Feng. My research interests mainly revolve around the captivating fields of human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. The convergence of technology and human experiences has always fascinated me due to the boundless possibilities it presents.

I am also excited to announce that in May 2023, I was honored to receive the Monash University-China Scholarship Council (CSC) Joint Scholarship. This highly esteemed scholarship has opened up exciting new horizons for me as I embark on my Ph.D. journey. I am eagerly looking forward to joining Monash University and collaborating with Prof. Florian 'Floyd' Mueller and the Exertion Games Lab on exploring interactive food.
